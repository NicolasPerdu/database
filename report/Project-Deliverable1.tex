\section{Entity-Relationship Diagram}
Let's put words on the data, discussing what could be entities, or relationships (not attributes).\\
\begin{itemize}
\item An artist comes from an area.
\item An artist plays in a set of genres.
\item An artist can write tracks.
\item Tracks are recordings, present on the physical/digital port of a release, at some position.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
The only decision that needs explaining is the fact that Track is a relation, and not an entity.\\
Here, an analogy with the real world is necessary. A track is usually considered to be a recording. 
Its physical support doesn't affect the property of the object : it is a piece of music.\\
The same way, a port of an album is just that, a port. We have different ports of the same object (the release) on different formats (the medium).\\
So a recording is the x-th track on some port of a release. Hence the aggregations.\\
Note that not all recordings have made it to be released.\\
\section{Key/Participation Constraints}
An artist can only come from one area, however, an area can have spawned many artists.\\
There is a Many-to-one key constraint between Artist and Area.\\
An artist is considered an artist only after he has started producing music. This music will have a genre (even if it is a brand new one).\\
There is a total participation constraint on Artists and the "Plays in" relation.\\
What has been written is always a track, and a track has always been written : total participation constraint between Track and Wrote.\\
A port always has a track (this is a supposition), and a track always belongs to a port : total participation constraint between Track and Port.\\

An artist can still be an artist even though he hasn't released any tracks, so there can't be a constraint there.\\

\section{Interface}
The php extension php_oci8 should be enabled.

The interface is done in PHP in two files :
index.php - display the result when a query is send with the form.
func.php - contain the main function: \textit{page($query)}, compute the result of the query and return an array.

The function \textit{page($query)} is simple, we use oci_connect to obtain a connexion.
We use \textit{oci_parse} to parse the query given as parameter, 
and then we execute the query with \textit{oci_execute} and get the result with \textit{oci_fetch_array}
If the query is performed on the table release, instead of displaying the releaseID, we create a form with a hidden button, 
so that the user can know more about track with this id, the query perform is \textit{SELECT * FROM Track WHERE ReleaseID = id}
